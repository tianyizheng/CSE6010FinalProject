## A Discrete Event Simulation for Waiting Time Estimation 
## Contributors: Tianyi Zheng, Xiaoyu Yang, Yu Zheng

## Compilation
Navigate into the root. Compile the simulation using:
`gcc application.c engine.c -o build`

## Execution
Run the simulation using:
`./build`

You can also change the variables in application.c under "variables that affect performance" to experiment with different scenarios
